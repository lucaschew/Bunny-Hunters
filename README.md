# Bunny Hunters

A project I made in Grade 11

Similar to the Stardew Valley minigame: Journey of the Prairie King, but with bunnies
Created with powerups, and a built-in highscore chart
Created AI bots that chased the player and a max bullet counter for the hunter

I don't own any of the image assets
